# Continuity

Public-safe engineering handover for PersonaLattice. Verify GitHub before changing anything; this file is a checkpoint, not authority over the repository.

Never place API keys, real research identifiers, retained-case data, password hashes, session material or unredacted investigation screenshots here.

## Repository checkpoint

- Repository: `tushar-rawat-22/persona-lattice`
- Default branch: `main`
- Local checkout convention: `~/persona-lattice`
- License: Apache-2.0 for original code
- Product: private evidence-first public/authorized research workbench
- Operating model: one authenticated operator; public route is demo/preview only
- Verified implementation main after PR #68: `e3a22e2d48789cf4a9957cf5ca34abb52d4222ac`
- PR #68 exact tested head: `2c14304017983a47b3baebecc0ddf566fb10c600`
- PR #68 CI run: `32112042910`, success across API 3.11/3.13, dependency audits, Ruff, web and deployment image
- PR #68 API suite: 356 passed on Python 3.11; Python 3.13 also passed
- Documentation standard: `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`

PR #68 closes a cross-layer V2-D consistency gap. Source catalog, executable bindings, provider descriptors and the process-wide `ProviderRuntime` were each tested before, but no derived invariant proved that the layers agreed. CI now requires the governed binding provider set to equal the shared runtime adapter set exactly, requires each runtime adapter to use its reviewed descriptor, and prevents planned/unreviewed sources from entering production runtime ownership without crossing catalog and binding admission first. ADR 0040 records the decision.

The same guard now locks the zero-spend baseline generically: every required `ACTIVE` recursive source must remain zero-spend eligible. A current recursive source that is not zero-spend eligible may exist only as `OPTIONAL`. Brave therefore remains an optional metered extension rather than a required product dependency.

## Permanent evidence semantics

- Observations, factual Claims and correlation results remain separate.
- Every factual conclusion keeps provenance.
- A discovered clue is a research lead, not proof of identity.
- Same-handle reuse alone is weak evidence.
- M5 is deterministic evidence-strength triage, not identity probability.
- `calibration_status=uncalibrated` and `is_identity_claim=false` remain fixed.
- Contradictions/vetoes and stale evidence remain visible.
- Unknown, not-found, unavailable, blocked and budget-stopped remain distinct outcomes.
- No AI/ML/embedding/biometric identity decision is in the correlation path.

## Permanent security, privacy and cost boundary

Allowed scope is attributable public information and explicitly authorized data. PersonaLattice does not add private-account bypass, login/account-recovery enumeration, password/OTP/session/token collection, CAPTCHA/WAF/proxy/Tor evasion, hidden KYC/government-ID acquisition, covert personal/device IP discovery, live tracking, covert subject contact or regulated eligibility decisioning.

The baseline must work with zero paid APIs, zero paid database, zero paid hosting requirement, zero paid proxy network and zero paid enrichment. Metered integrations can exist only as optional extensions. Missing optional configuration must degrade explicitly rather than breaking baseline research.

Brave remains optional/metered. No `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` means no Brave attempt. Do not make it mandatory or expand its query scope during architecture closure.

Uploaded content is untrusted data. Extraction is never execution authority. A candidate enters the executable lead path only after explicit human review/authorization, and only for supported identifier kinds.

## Stable architecture

- Next.js UI: `apps/web`
- FastAPI API: `services/api`
- evidence/persistence/normalization: `services/api/app/evidence`
- bounded file intake + review: `services/api/app/uploads`
- upload-review HTTP boundary: `services/api/app/upload_review_api.py`
- reviewed-candidate case execution: `services/api/app/uploads/research_service.py`
- governed provider execution: `services/api/app/providers`
- deterministic correlation: `services/api/app/correlation`
- convergence: `services/api/app/convergence.py`
- typed leads/frontier/source planning/reporting/evaluation: `services/api/app/intelligence`
- quick research: `services/api/app/research.py`
- retained cases: `services/api/app/cases.py`
- source expansion design: `docs/V2_SOURCE_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`

M0-M6 are complete. Private V1 one-admin research, retention/deletion, audit, local HTTPS-tunnel acceptance and the ephemeral canonical evidence graph are implemented.

## V2 checkpoint

### V2-A — typed lead graph — complete

PR #20. Exact-field lead extraction, M1-consistent normalization, typed dispositions and blocked sensitive field classes.

### V2-B — deterministic frontier — complete

PR #21. Reservation-safe frontier, duplicate/cycle suppression, reason-coded outcomes and bounded lead-graph report state. Production limits remain depth 2 / 12 nodes.

### V2-C — capability registry/planner — complete

PR #22. Capability, lifecycle/cost/configuration/review state and zero-spend planning are separated from execution authority.

### V2-D — runtime consistency and architecture closure — active

Current network execution ownership:

- Sherlock — governed runtime
- GitHub — governed runtime
- GitLab — governed runtime
- Codeforces — governed runtime
- public DNS — governed runtime
- optional Brave exact-match search — governed runtime
- executable legacy network allowance — **empty**

Key provider/runtime PRs: #24-#32, #50, #52, #54.

Key source-state/report/evaluation PRs: #34-#48. These establish typed source states/reasons, privacy-bounded projections, factual quick-research population, deterministic per-source counters, full-vocabulary fixture coverage, graph-growth/duplicate counters, label-gated wrong-pivot measurement and network-free graph-limit comparison through the real frontier scheduler.

Document-intake/review checkpoints:

- PR #56: deterministic candidate character spans plus fail-closed reviewed identifier promotion contract;
- PR #58: extraction-time PDF page spans, exact page attribution and corrected flattened-text bounds;
- PR #60: short-lived server-owned candidate review persistence without raw document retention;
- PR #62/#63: atomic server-owned confirm/reject/re-review/promotion service with immutable candidate value/provenance and a hardened generic update seam;
- PR #64: authenticated + CSRF-protected HTTP confirm/reject/reopen/promote actions;
- PR #66: separate authenticated retained-case execution from a currently confirmed, research-authorized server-owned candidate.

Architecture consistency checkpoint:

- PR #68: cross-layer catalog/binding/registry/shared-runtime ownership and zero-spend invariants; ADR 0040.

The document-review backend now reaches a retained quick or converged case without trusting browser-supplied candidate data and without making review actions trigger provider execution.

## Source-run semantics

Retained source-run records carry logical source name, lead kind, state/reason, observation count and execution/terminal flags. They do not duplicate identifier values, source locators, provider payloads, secrets or exception text.

Critical distinctions:

- completed call with results → `executed / results_returned`;
- completed call with zero results → `not_found / no_match`;
- optional source absent → `unavailable / optional_not_configured`, no attempt;
- local budget stop → `budget_stopped / local_budget`, no provider contact;
- provider-policy rejection → blocked, no attempt;
- required server-side secret absent → unavailable, no attempt;
- remote rate limit / proven execution failure → unavailable, attempted;
- returned malformed result → unavailable, attempted only when post-attempt phase is mechanically proven;
- generic `ProviderValidationError` → no source-run record because its phase is ambiguous.

`source_provider_exception_record()` is the governed provider-exception mapping authority. Warnings are human context only and are never parsed into source state.

## Current deliberate limits

- convergence max depth: 2;
- convergence max nodes: 12;
- no new third-party provider activation during V2-D closure;
- planned sources remain non-executable;
- newly discovered phone leads require review;
- contextual name/organization/location remain non-autonomous;
- public-search snippets do not become automatic identifier leads;
- Brave remains optional and excluded from the zero-spend requirement;
- no identity probability or universal-account claims.

## Immediate next gate

The private operator UI remains the next product-facing block: wire document review/run state, explicit provider-start controls, retained seed provenance and existing source-state/evaluation summaries without re-deriving backend semantics in the browser.

For backend architecture closure, continue the final V2-D consistency audit over report/privacy boundaries and stale compatibility seams. PR #68 means runtime ownership and the zero-spend dependency invariant are no longer open questions. Do not activate new third-party providers until V2-D closure is explicitly recorded.

## Update discipline

For every meaningful block record verified main/branch/PR state, CI evidence, behavior changes, explicit non-changes, corrected assumptions, unresolved risks and the exact next gate. Keep public/operator prose separate from assistant handover prose.
